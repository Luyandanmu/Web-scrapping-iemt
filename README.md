# Simple Classification Example

#This repository contains a basic example of machine learning using classification with a decision tree. 
#The example demonstrates how to classify the Iris dataset and visualize the decision tree.

The `classification_example.py` script performs the following steps:
1. Load Dataset: Loads the Iris dataset, which includes features and target labels for different iris species.
2. Split Data: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train Model: Uses `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn` to train the model on the training set.
4. Make Predictions: Predicts the target labels for the test set.
5. Evaluate Model: Calculates the accuracy of the model on the test set.
6. Visualize Decision Tree: Plots the decision tree to visualize the classification rules.
